                If you are researching iPhone app development, you’ve probably
                heard of Swift. It’s a powerful, intuitive programming language,
                created and supported by Apple, and used to build applications
                for iOS. Although older applications were often written in ObjC,
                Swift is the go-to choice for new applications, as a faster,
                more secure, and future-proof choice. With each case, our
                developers choose the stack carefully to deliver top-notch
                applications, made to fit specific business needs.

                If you’re thinking about building an app for both Android and
                iOS, there are two approaches to consider. Should you develop
                two separate native apps, or just one that will work on both
                platforms? We’re here to make sure you take the right path! If

                  If application speed and top-notch performance are your
                  priorities, you should go for native development. Native iOS
                  apps tend to run faster than cross-platform ones, as they are
                  written in Swift, which is supported by the platform’s
                  ecosystem.

                  application. These are what we call native application
                  features, and they usually are more difficult to develop for
                  cross-platform. Even seemingly simple functionalities tend to
                  perform better within native applications.

                  Thinking about a product that you can expand over the years?
                  Native iOS development will be a safe bet here. As a mature,
                  well-supported language, Swift is less likely to change as
                  dynamically as cross-platform frameworks. Also, note that
                  native apps are faster to scale, implement changes, and add
                  new features into, as there is only one platform that needs to
                  be configured. Keep that in mind if you’re expecting your iOS
                  app to grow rapidly or change in the future.

                  If you plan to transfer the project to in-house in the future,

                  Native iOS development results in a better app experience for

                  interface to work well on both platforms. Remember that when

                  develop certain platform-specific features that may affect the
