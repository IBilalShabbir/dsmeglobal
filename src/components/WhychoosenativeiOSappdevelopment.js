              it’s better to develop a native iOS application. These are what we
              call native application features, and they usually are more
              difficult to develop for cross-platform. Even seemingly simple
              functionalities tend to perform better within native applications.

              Thinking about a product that you can expand over the years?
              Native iOS development will be a safe bet here. As a mature,
              well-supported language, Swift is less likely to change as
              dynamically as cross-platform frameworks. Also, note that native
              apps are faster to scale, implement changes, and add new features
              into, as there is only one platform that needs to be configured.
              Keep that in mind if you’re expecting your iOS app to grow rapidly
              or change in the future.

              If you plan to transfer the project to in-house in the future,

              more challenging to find skilled cross-platform developers, while
              building your own team of native iOS developers shouldn’t pose a
              big challenge.

              Native iOS development results in a better app experience for your

              work well on both platforms. Remember that when it comes to iOS
              native development, it’s easier and faster to develop certain
              platform-specific features that may affect the UX, such as widgets
              or app clips. Also, keep in mind that smooth and fast performance
              of a native application makes the user experience more satisfying.
