        First things first! We identify the scope of your project and take our
        time to understand your needs, business plans, and expectations. If you
        decide to develop an MVP first, we define its scope together. Thanks to
        that, we can give you a general development quotation and schedule.

        <span>Shaping the vision and discussing the details</span>
        We want to make sure your idea turns into a huge success. To help you
        choose the best strategy or sharpen your vision, we put together a
        session of Data, Product or Strategy workshops â€“ whatever best fits your
        needs. At the end of this phase, we have wireframes of your app and the
        first design drafts, weâ€™ve gathered development requirements, and
        prepared the basic documentation of the project. All set!

        <span>Bringing your project idea into reality</span>
        Time to get to work! Once the project kicks off, we complete the
        designs, and start developing your application. Also, we see you as our
        development partner and thatâ€™s why we encourage you to be fully engaged
        throughout the project. The length of this phase depends on the app size
        and complexity. It usually takes us 3 months to create a
        fully-functional MVP.

        Are you planning to equip your app with functions like biometrics,

        better to develop a native iOS application. These are what we call
        native application features, and they usually are more difficult to

        As Swift is a more mature language than any of the cross-platform ones,
        it is more dependable when it comes to community support or available
        development resources. They are also less prone to dynamic changes.
        Also, note that Swift is officially supported by Apple. It is in their

        maintenance and development.

        Thinking about a product that you can expand over the years? Native iOS
        development will be a safe bet here. As a mature, well-supported
        language, Swift is less likely to change as dynamically as
        cross-platform frameworks. Also, note that native apps are faster to
        scale, implement changes, and add new features into, as there is only
        one platform that needs to be configured. Keep that in mind if youâ€™re
        expecting your iOS app to grow rapidly or change in the future.

        Native iOS development results in a better app experience for your
        users. As native applications are written with only one platform in
        mind, there is no need to compromise on the user interface to work well
        on both platforms. Remember that when it comes to iOS native
        development, itâ€™s easier and faster to develop certain platform-specific
        features that may affect the UX, such as widgets or app clips. Also,
        keep in mind that smooth and fast performance of a native application
        makes the user experience more satisfying.
